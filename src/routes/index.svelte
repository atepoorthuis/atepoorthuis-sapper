  Hi, I'm Ate Poorthuis. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Humanities, Arts and
  Social Sciences at Singapore University of Technology and Design. My research
  explores the possibilities and limitations of big data, through quantitative
  analysis and visualization, to better understand how our cities work. I have a
  particular interest in the practical application of these academic insights
  within urban planning and policy. Other projects I have worked on include the
  DOLLY Project, a repository of billions of geolocated social media, which is
  used to address the difficulties of using big data within the social sciences.
